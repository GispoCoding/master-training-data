# GeoServer REST API {#rest}

The GeoServer REST API can be used to perform the same actions that are available in the GeoServer web UI.
The [GeoServer REST API documentation](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/rest/index.html) is a good resource for getting started with using the REST API.

It's useful to know some basic REST principles before getting started.
REST, short for Representational state transfer, is a software architecture style especially common on the internet.
REST APIs are commonly used for creating, reading, updating, or deleting pieces of content, called *resources*.

RESTful APIs are commonly called by making requests using **HTTP methods** such as GET, POST, and DELETE.
These requests may contain a data payload called a **body**, which is typically in JSON format.
Additional **headers** may also be included to provide further information to the server, such as user authentication or the preferred response format.
Requests are made to specific URLs/routes, called service **endpoints**.

Based on the endpoint, HTTP method, body, and headers, the server processes the request and returns a response.
Responses have a HTTP status code indicating the status of the response, see the list of [HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes).
There may also be a data payload, such as an error message, which is again typically in JSON format.

The GeoServer REST API of the training machines can be accessed on `http://<base-url>/geoserver/rest`.
The `geoserver/rest` endpoint is often called the *base URL* of the GeoServer REST API.

## Using APIs

Many tools exist for calling REST APIs.
Two popular GUI tools are [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/).
Both allow users to generate and send requests to the GS REST API.
These tools can also import OpenAPI definitions to show available paths and schemas.

**Note:** while the [GeoServer REST API documentation](https://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/rest/index.html) is useful for learning about the GS REST API, it is not suitable for reading the API schema and structure to tools such as Insomnia.
As stated on the index page:

"The API is documented as Swagger 2.0 files.
However, these files have been written by hand back in 2017, and have not always been kept up to date with the evolution of the GeoServer configuration object structure.
Also, they have not been tested for proper client generation, and will likely not work for that purpose.
Take them only as a form of documentation."
:::

There's also various options to call the GS REST API programmatically.
These include the command-line tool curl, that's not as intuitive to use compared to tools like Insomnia, but is widely available on Linux systems and can be easily used in scripts.
Many text editors and IDEs such as Visual Studio Code and IntelliJ IDEA support defining and making API calls in `.rest` files.
The GS API can also be called from various programming languages.

## Exercise — REST API

The examples in this exercise are based on [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest), a free tool for designing and testing APIs that can be [installed](https://docs.insomnia.rest/insomnia/install) on most operating systems.
While installing Insomnia is not strictly required to complete the exercise, it's a highly useful tool especially for those unfamiliar with REST APIs.
If using Insomnia, start by creating a new Request Collection called gs-training from the Create button in the top-right corner of the dashboard window.
Then edit the base configuration with the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + E` (or clicking No environment → Manage environments near the top-left corner) and fill in the following:

```
{
  "base_url": "http://<base-url>/geoserver/rest"
}
```

Replacing `<base-url>` with the URL of your training machine.
Click done.
Create a new request (`Ctrl + N` or right-click the left panel → New request).
Set the HTTP method type and request name as desired.
You can use `base_url` as a *variable* in your HTTP requests by typing `{{ base_url }}` in the URL field.
For example, to call `http://<base-url>/geoserver/rest/layers` simply type `{{ base_url }}/layers`.

**Hint:** GeoServer accepts Basic authentication, read [Authentication to OWS and REST services](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/security/auth/owsrest.html) for more details.
In Insomnia, Basic authentication details can be provided on the Auth tab.
:::

One of the most common use cases for the REST API, especially when running a passive cluster, is triggering a catalog reload when the contents of the GS data directory change.
While the implementation details differ based on programming language, the API call is always the same.
Read the [/reload endpoint documentation](https://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/api/#1.0.0/reload.yaml) (and optionally, the [GeoServer documentation article](https://docs.geoserver.org/master/en/user/rest/api/reload.html)) for details.

Try triggering a catalog reload using the API.
If using Insomnia, create a new request first.
What response do you get, and what does it mean?
Try until you get a successful result (HTTP return code 200).

You can also make GET requests in your web browser.
Open a new Incognito window in your browser and try opening `http://<base-url>/geoserver/rest/layers`.
You are likely prompted for credentials, **click cancel**.
What result do you see, and why?

:::{.hint-box}
**Hint:** the developer tools panel is a highly useful tool to inspect HTTP requests made by your browser.
In Chrome, open the developer tools panel by hitting F12.
Then, click on the Network tab, and reload the page with F5.
:::

In the same incognito window, open the GS web interface at `http://<base-url>/geoserver/web/` and log in using your credentials.
Then try opening `http://<base-url>/geoserver/rest/layers` again.
Examine the HTTP requests made by the browser and see what headers are added to the request.

After successfully completing the catalog reload using the REST API, create a new request.
This time, try getting a list of all layers in the `topp` workspace in XML format.

:::{.hint-box}
**Hint:** if using Insomnia, you can duplicate requests using `Ctrl+D` or right-clicking on the request in the side panel and selecting Duplicate.
This way you don't have to keep re-filling the authentication details to each request.
:::

After getting all the layers, create two new requests to:

- Get information about the layer `topp:states` in JSON format.
- Download the default style used for `topp:states` in SLD format.

Finally, let's modify the layer a bit.
This is a more challenging request, as you have to also provide a request body in either JSON or XML format.
See if you can create *one* request to:

- Change the default style of `topp:states` to `polygon`
- Remove the previous default style of `topp:states` from the list of available styles.

**Hint:** If you can't get the requests to work, the correct requests made by the `curl` tool are added as a comment to this HTML document.
Right-click on *this text* and select Developer tools → Inspect element.
Then scroll down in the developer tools panel to see the comment with the answers.

Get a list of layers in the topp workspace in XML format:
curl --request GET \
  --url http://$BASE_URL/workspaces/topp/layers.xml \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46Z2lzcG90cmFpbmluZw=='

Get information about the layer topp:states in JSON format:
curl --request GET \
  --url http://$BASE_URL/layers/topp:states.json \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46Z2lzcG90cmFpbmluZw=='

Download the default style used for topp:states in SLD format.
curl --request GET \
  --url http://$BASE_URL/styles/population.sld \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46Z2lzcG90cmFpbmluZw=='

Change default style to polygon and remove population style from list of available styles:
curl --request PUT \
  --url http://$BASE_URL/layers/topp:states.json \
  --header 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46Z2lzcG90cmFpbmluZw==' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "layer": {
    "defaultStyle": {
      "name": "polygon",
      "href": "http://$BASE_URL\/styles\/polygon.json"
    },
    "styles": {
      "@class": "linked-hash-set",
      "style": [
        {
          "name": "polygon",
          "href": "http://$BASE_URL\/styles\/polygon.json"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}'
-->


Verify the default style has changed by viewing the `topp:states` layer using GeoServer's Layer Preview.
