# Exercise 8: Processing algorithms

## Background

The purpose of this exercise is to become familiar with writing
processing algorithms.

You can write processing algorithms which are independent and
written to their owen `.py` file and added to the QGIS processing
panel. However an algorithm can also be included in a plugin, which
has a few benefits. In this case a _provider_ is defined for the
algorithm which allows for clearer organization of different
algorithms.

Multiple algorithms can be included in one plugin which allows
distributing algorithms easier. Different providers can be seen
in the QGIS GUI:

![Provider > group > algorithm](img/exercise_8/image1.png){width=75%}

When writing algorithms creating the GUI for them works differently.
There are specific widgets for algorithms and they are defined
programmatically. This means that you cannot directly create a GUI
for an algorithm with Qt Designer.

Writing the actual processing script works similarly regardless
of whether it's independent or included in a plugin.

Let's look at a minimal example of a processing script. This
is largely based on the script template included in QGIS.
This algorithm takes in a source vector layer and as an output
creates an exact copy of the source layer.

### Calling a processing algorithm

If you want to call a processing algorithm using Python
from the console, script, plugin or another
processing algorithm you can use the following code.
`qgis.processing` has to be imported. Note that
the parameters of the algorithm are given as a dictionary
and the keys are the values of the constant variables
defined in the algorithm.

::: code-box
```python
# from qgis import processing

input_layer_id = iface.activeLayer().id()
parameters = {
    'INPUT': input_layer_id,
    'DISTANCE': 1.5,
    'SEGMENTS': 5,
    'END_CAP_STYLE': 0,
    'JOIN_STYLE': 0,
    'MITER_LIMIT': 2,
    'DISSOLVE': False,
    'OUTPUT': 'memory:'
}

output = processing.run('native:buffer', parameters)

# note that here the processing.run() method
# returns a dictionary.
# The output layer can be retrieved with
# the 'OUTPUT' key
buffered_layer = output.get('OUTPUT')

QgsProject.instance().addMapLayer(buffered_layer)
```
:::

## Algorithms in a plugin

The actual structure of an algorithm which is included in
a plugin is exactly the same. However a provider needs
to be defined for the plugin with which the algorithms
are added to the QGIS processing toolbox.

When you created the plugin from the cookiecutter template
it was instructed to choose to include a processing algorithm
in the plugin. Because of this you already should have a
base for writing your own algorithm.

However let's go over how the algorithm ends up in the QGIS
GUI.

The `test-plugin/testplugin` folder should have a subfolder
called `testplugin_processing`. It includes two Python files,
`provider.py` and `processing_algorithm.py`.

Here the attributes of the provider are defined including its name,
icon and identifier etc. The most crucial function however is `loadAlgorithms()`.
Here the actual algorithms are added to the provider. First the algorithm
has to be imported which has already been done at the start of the file.
The provider can have multiple algorithms, in which case all of them have to
be imported and added to the `loadAlgorithms()` function.

The _provider_ itself is added to QGIS in the `test-plugin/testplugin/plugin.py`
file.

```

You can also add more than one provider to the plugin.

## Exercise 8.1: Writing an algorithm

Edit the algorithm in the
`test-plugin/testplugin/testplugin_processing/processing_algorithm.py`
so it works in the following way:

_Parameters:_

* Source layer (QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSource): only point layers can be chosen.
* Point parameter (QgsProcessingParameterPoint)
* Output layer (QgsProcessingParameterFeatureSink)

_Processing:_

* The algorithm calculates the distance between each point in the source
layer to the point chosen by the user.
* If the point chosen by the user differs from the source layer CRS
it is transformed into the correct CRS.
* To the source layer a new field "distance" is added to which the distance
between the points is added
  * All the other fields and values stay the same!
* Update the progress bar and if needed send messages to the user,
for example the CRS is transformed

## Exercise 8.2: Tests for the algorithm

Create a file `test-plugin/tests/test_processing_algorithm`.
Write a test which tests at least that the correct distance
is calculated to the points in the output layer. You can
use this as a base:
