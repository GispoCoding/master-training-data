# Exercise 1: Python console

**Contents:** The QGIS Python console and script editor.

**Goal:** To become familiar with the Python console and
writing and running scripts in the script editor.

::: note-box
In the following exercises it is assumed that you're familiar
with the basics of Python. If necessary you can go through
the Python refresher [here](00_exercise0.html).
:::

The simplest way to use the Python API in QGIS is through the
Python console, into which you can enter and run single commands
or longer script. On Windows a separate Python interpreter is
included with the installation in addition to some Python packages.
These include the QGIS python package (PyQGIS) and the gdal/ogr
library. In addition to these PyQt is included which is the Python
binding for the Qt library which can be used to create a graphical
user interface (GUI) for plugins.

::: hint-box
Python is integrated slightly differently between operating systems.
On Window and MacOS a Python interpreter is included in the QGIS
installation while on Linux-based systems QGIS uses the system-wide
Python interpreter.
:::

You can access the Python console in a few different ways:

- Through the top menu: Plugins > Python Console
- With a hot key: Ctrl + Alt + P
- By clicking the Python logo in the toolbar

You can use the icon with the green triangle (run button)
or the Enter key to execute commands you've written in the console.
The other buttons work as follows:

Open the script editor which makes it easier to write and run longer scripts

- ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qgis/QGIS/master/images/themes/default/console/iconClearConsole.svg)
Clears the console of prior outputs

Contains links to the PyQGIS documentation, PyQGIS cookbook and
instructions for using the console.

You can open the script editor and inspect its features.

## Structure of the exercises

## Examples

In the following exercises there are many examples of Python code. We
recommend that while going through the exercises you copy these
code examples to the QGIS script editor and run the code. You can
also change the code in the examples and try different things around.
The examples are given in a code box whose contents you can copy by
dragging your mouse cursor in the box and clicking the copy button
that appears in the top right corner.

::: code-box
```python
# Example code

print("Run me as an example!")
```

## Exercises

We recommend to write the answers to the exercises also in the script
editor. A hint is sometimes given with the exercises that points you
in the right direction. There's also always an example answer. These
can be seen with the **Show answer** and **Show hint** buttons.
We recommend that you try to write your on answer first and look at
the example answer only at the end. Also, there are many ways to solve
the same problem and the example answers are just one way!

## Exercise 1.1

Set the value of a variable called `a` to 5 and print the value of the
variable.

<button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)" class="btn answer_btn">hint</button>

::: hidden-box
::: code-box
```python
# set the value
a = 5

# what function can you use to print the value?
```
:::

<button onclick="toggleAnswer(this)" class="btn answer_btn">answer</button>

::: hidden-box
::: code-box
```python
a = 5

print(5)
```

Extra tips for using the console:

- The console is nicely suited for inspecting the attributes of PyQGIS objects
and testing them. It also supports code completion for the PyQGIS libraries.

- Multiline commands such as a for loop can be run in the console. In these
cases three dots appear to indicate that the console is waiting extra commands.
Note that you still have to add the typical Python indentations

- You can use the arrow keys (up and down) to browse through the history of
entered commands

- The console panel likely opens in the bottom of the QGIS window, but it can
be detached and either docked to different parts of the QGIS GUI or used as
a separate window
