# EXERCISE 2.3: ARCHITECTURE AND DEPLOYMENT

**Content of the exercise**

This exercise will introduce you to the GeoServer logs and the different settings that affect performance.

**Aim of the exercise**

After the exercise, the student will be able to evaluate GeoServer's performance using logs and identify different problem situations.

**Estimated duration**

30 minutes.

## **Preparation**

The GeoServer server has been loaded with various data and the GeoServer **Monitor** plugin has been installed on the server.

## **General information about the GeoServer server**

Open **About & Status → Server Status** from the left bar of GeoServer. ![](img/harjoitus_10/image1.png)

The **Locks** function allows you to check existing locks on WFS-T data. If necessary, you can release the locks by pressing **Free locks**.

The **Connections** information refers to the number of vector stores available. 

You can check and release the memory used by GeoServer under **Memory Usage**.

## **Image Processing Settings**

Check again which Java settings are in use on the server for image processing. By default, it is not very efficient to process images as a whole in computer memory. A commonly used method is to split images into smaller parts (tiles) and do any image operators on the smaller images. The JAI settings (defined in the **Image Processing** settings) control the operation of these methods.

You can edit the JAI (Java Advanced Imaging) settings via **Settings → Image Processing** view. ![](img/harjoitus_10/image2.png)

PUT A TABLE HERE FROM DOCS (?)

Changes to the settings are visible in the **Server Status** page.

## **Raster Access**

Unlike WMS image requests, WCS requests produce potentially very large image files. In these cases, downloading images from memory is not a good solution and it would be preferable to use a temporary file.

The **Raster Access** settings determine the behaviour of GeoServer when image requests arrive. You can view the settings in the **Settings → Raster Access** view:

+-----------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                         | #### **Raster Access settings** \|                                                                                     |
+-----------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **ImageIO cache memory threshold (KB)** | Image requests above this value will be handled using a temporary file cache, otherwise a cache memory will be used \| |
+-----------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **CPU Use**                             | Settings for the processes used during the creation of raster images                                                   |
+-----------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

![](img/harjoitus_10/image3.png)

At the end of the **Server Status** view, you will find settings related to the server:

+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                               | #### **Other server settings** \|                                                                                                                                         |
+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Update Sequence**           | Tells you how many times changes have been made to the server settings.                                                                                                   |
+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Resource cache**            | GeoServer stores store connections, external images, and the configuration of object types, fonts and coordinate systems. If necessary, the cache data can be deleted. \| |
+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Configuration and catalog** | All GeoServer configuration settings are loaded into the server memory. If necessary, they can be reloaded. \|                                                            |
+-------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

## **GeoServer's log**

Explore the contents of the GeoServer log and its settings by making requests to the server using the preview function.

In a separate browser window, open a layer preview (**Layer Preview**) and keep the map window open.

In a different browser window, open **Settings → Global** from the right bar.

In the third browser window, open the GeoServer logs preview (**GeoServer Logs**).

![](img/harjoitus_10/image4.png)

Familiarise yourself with the settings with the guidance of your trainer and by reading more about the settings in the Geoserver manual (**Web Administration Interface → Server → Global Settings**). Open the manual in a separate browser window.

Now perform some operations (zoom in, zoom out, pan) in the map window.

Check if anything was added to the logs: press **Refresh** and the latest lines from the log file will be displayed. You can also reduce the number of log lines (**Maximum console lines**).

The GeoServer installation comes pre-loaded with different log profiles that report different information to the log.

![](img/harjoitus_10/image5.png)

You can now switch between different logging profiles and observe the effects of actions on log files. Try setting the profile to VERBOSE_LOGGING.properties and drag the map. Then refresh the log and see what lines have appeared in the log.

## **REST API functionality**

It is also possible to manage GeoServer server settings via the REST interface.

You can check the data available through the REST interface by typing the following address in a web browser (use the ip address of your own server):

::: note-box
[http://[your-training-instance]/geoserver/rest/workspaces/](http://%3Eoma-ip-osoite:8080/geoserver/rest/workspaces/){.uri}
:::

Find information on the map layers created in the previous exercises.

Psst! See the description of the REST API in the GeoServer Help.

## **Using the Monitor plugin (tarkista nämä vielä)**

GeoServer's **Monitor** plugin is pre-installed on the training servers and can be seen in the main menu below.

Open **Monitor → Activity**.

Try previewing the different layers and then look in **Monitor → Activity → Daily** at the system activity graph, which should look like this: ![](img/harjoitus_10/image7.png) ![](img/harjoitus_10/image8.png)
